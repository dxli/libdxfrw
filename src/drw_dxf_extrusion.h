// Explicit recovery of the representation produced by exactly one legacy
// DRW_Circle/DRW_Arc::applyExtrusion() call. This is an opt-in conversion for
// DXF writers and the bounded AC1024 DWG writer route: it does not alter the
// semantics of existing readers or writers.
//
// The caller must know that the input was transformed exactly once and that
// subsequent edits have not invalidated its coordinate/normal interpretation.
// The input's haveExtrusion value must still be the one used by that call. If
// it was false, that call was a no-op and the output remains native. ARC angles
// reflect the legacy method's limited axial-negative-Z handling; this function
// is not a general conversion of arbitrary WCS angles.
//
// Exact built-in runtime types for both input and output, and matching input
// entity tags, are required to avoid slicing or partially overwriting derived
// payloads. A zero/nonfinite normal,
// nonfinite fields, type mismatch or unrepresentable result fails without
// changing the output; the input and output may alias. The returned copy is for
// native DXF OCS or AC1024 DWG output. Other DWG revisions are unqualified.
